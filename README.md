zoho_app
========

a desktop app written in wxperl to connect with zoho reports

it uses a local database and can import or export records
from a zoho report database.  the import function will
retrieve all the records from a zoho report table and then
delete them. the export function will send only one selected
record at a time to a specified table.  the concept is
to allow for remote cooperation but using a desktop app
for most operations.
